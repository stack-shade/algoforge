**${p.title}** (LeetCode #${p.number}) is **${difficultyArticle} ${p.difficulty}** problem that primarily trains **${topicStr}**.

### How to think about it

1. **Restate the goal** in your own words before coding.
2. Work a **tiny example** by hand so the invariant becomes obvious.
3. Identify the **pattern** — this problem aligns with **${patternStr}**.
4. Only then translate the idea into code.

### Why this problem matters

${p.difficulty === "Easy" ? "It builds core muscle memory you will reuse on harder variants." : p.difficulty === "Medium" ? "It sits in the sweet spot of interview difficulty: multiple valid approaches, clear trade-offs." : "Hard problems force you to combine patterns and prove complexity carefully — interview gold."}

  const interview: ContentSection = {
    id: "interview",
    title: "Interview Walkthrough",
    status: "ready",
    bodyMarkdown: `## Interview approach for ${p.title}

### Opening (30–60 seconds)

- Clarify inputs/outputs and edge cases (empty input, single element, duplicates, overflow).
- State a **brute force** so the interviewer knows you can solve it naively.
- Propose the **optimal direction** tied to **${patternStr}**.

### Core solution narrative

1. Define the **state** you track (pointers, DP cell, set membership, stack top, etc.).
2. Explain the **transition** when you process the next element.
3. Call out **time** (${p.timeComplexity}) and **space** (${p.spaceComplexity}) before coding.
4. Code cleanly; narrate variable names.

### What interviewers listen for

- Correctness on edge cases
- Complexity honesty
- Ability to discuss **trade-offs** (e.g., hash map space vs. sort + two pointers)

### Follow-up questions they may ask

- Can you solve it with less memory?
- What if the input stream is infinite / doesn't fit in RAM?
- How would tests look for adversarial inputs?

  const optimized: ContentSection = {

    title: "Optimized Approach",
    status: "ready",
    bodyMarkdown: `## Optimized solution notes

The reference solutions on AlgoForge target **${p.timeComplexity}** time and **${p.spaceComplexity}** space.

### Pattern focus: ${patternStr}

Use the pattern as a checklist:

${p.patterns.map((pat) => `- **${pat.replace(/-/g, " ")}** — confirm the invariant holds after each step`).join("\n") || "- Identify the dominant pattern and stick to one clear invariant"}

${
  p.hasMultipleSolutions
    ? "Multiple methods appear in the source solutions — compare them and explain when each is preferable."
    : "Start from the primary solution, then rewrite from memory to lock it in."
}

### Implementation tips

- Prefer readable names over micro-optimizations in interviews.
- Extract helpers only when they clarify (e.g., expand-around-center, DFS visit).
- After AC-level logic, re-scan for off-by-one and null checks.

| Measure | Bound |
|--------|-------|
| Time | **${p.timeComplexity}** |
| Space | **${p.spaceComplexity}** |

### How to justify this in an interview

- **Time:** count loops, map/set operations, and recursive branching; state average vs worst case if relevant.
- **Space:** include hash maps, recursion stack, and output allocation when the problem asks for it.

If your implementation differs from the reference, re-derive big-O from *your* code — never memorize a complexity you cannot defend.

1. **Skipping edge cases** — empty collections, single-element inputs, max constraints.
2. **Wrong invariant** for ${patternStr} — updating state too early or too late.
3. **Mutating input unexpectedly** when the problem forbids it.
4. **Off-by-one** in windows, ranges, or binary search bounds.
5. **Ignoring overflow / precision** for integer arithmetic problems.

The source file includes more than one method. Compare:

1. **Primary optimized path** — best complexity for typical interviews.
2. **Secondary approach** — often brute force, sorting-based, or space-optimized variant.

Practice articulating **when** you would pick each (constraints, readability, follow-ups).
